# Pilot Area Persona -- West Midlands

**Darren Beriro and Tom Fletcher**

This document summarises a collective understanding of the National Land
Data Programme (NLDP) West Midlands (WM) pilot area. It introduces the
pilot area partners and provides an outline of their progress, challenge
areas, goals, risks and opportunities.

**Who is working on the pilot area project?**

The West Midlands pilot area is being led by the West Midlands Combined
Authority (WMCA) and Transport for West Midlands (TfWM), a devolved
mayoral Combined Authority and embedded transport body. WMCA is made up
of eleven local councils and three local enterprise partnerships (LEPs).
It is responsible for strategic oversight of transport, housing, green
space, education, employment, fair and inclusive communities and climate
change in the region. WMCA is funded by and has direct accountability to
the central Government.

Key contacts and roles for WMCA include:

-   Stuart Lester, Data and Innovation Lead (TfWM)
-   Jacqueline Homan, Head of Environment (WMCA)
-   Jemma Hodgson, Strategic Assets Manager (WMCA)
-   John O'Kane, Asset Management Development Officer (WMCA)
-   TBC, Data analyst(?)

**Who are the local partners?**

WMCA and TfWM work most closely with the seven voting member Local
Authorities (Birmingham City Council, City of Wolverhampton Council,
Coventry City Council, Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, Sandwell
Metropolitan Borough Council, Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council and
Walsall). WMCA also works in partnership with a further four local
councils and three LEPs. WMCA also has good working relationships with
adjacent councils not part of the Combined Authority under their Duty to
Cooperate. WMCA and TfWM are well connected with a range of wider
stakeholders in the region.

**What problems are planned to be addressed during the NLDP?**

-   Making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)
    for transport planning/ modelling and early-stage strategic land use
    planning

-   Improving understanding of land ownership for early stage strategic
    planning

-   Coupling planning data with land ownership data for UPRNs and other
    relevant land parcels

-   How to record and report windfall sites in housing needs assessments
    and Strategic Housing Land Availability Assessments

-   How best to adapt, extend, enhance and maintain data schema for the
    above problems

-   Use of novel data proxies e.g. waste bin registrations, to monitor
    housing build out rate

-   How to enhance the awareness and impact of TfWM in the wider
    planning role of WMCA

-   How to enhance maintain and enhance the value to all parties of the
    Duty to Cooperate requirements

-   How to create unified data quality through standardised schema or
    data model

**What does success look like for WMCA?**

Within the duration of the NLDP, WMCA would like to develop a working
prototype West Midland Land Use Platform with a strong set of use cases
to embed this into data-driven decision making in the CA.

The focus of the platform is on transport, housing and brownfield use
cases and integrating data currently available on separate systems e.g.
planning applications and the WM land and property gazetteer. Some
initial user research has been conducted, which will be made available
to the NLDP. Key features of the West Midlands Land Use Platform would
include:

-   Data platform for early-stage land use planning viability
    assessments

-   Maintained land ownership register

-   Planning to completion housing build outs

-   Unified data schema for WM

It is expected that the NLDP will focus on a current use case/
demonstrator orientated around master planning and regeneration of dense
urban areas e.g. the redevelopment of Bilston market in Wolverhampton.
This would permit testing how decisions (past, present and future) may
be influenced by the NLDP and West Midlands Land Use Platform.

**Risks and opportunities**

-   WMCA wide + extended partners data sharing agreements

-   Reticence to share some data by certain LPAs especially where it
    relates to a strong green belt lobby

-   LA legal team push back affects collaboration in some cases

-   Capacity issues due to large scale infrastructure projects e.g. HS2
    and Commonwealth Games 2022 (and 5G project?)

-   Skills shortage in WM due to digital personnel drain from WMCA to
    private sector

-   Separate data management systems e.g. planning records, transport
    and land ownership need to made interoperable

-   Longer term Â£1b settlement received by WMCA meaning secure reliable
    funding

-   Approaches to digital planning by GLA and GMCA can inform good
    practice for WM
