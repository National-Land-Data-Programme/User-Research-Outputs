#### National land data Programme

### Pilot Area Persona -- Devon

**Tom Fletcher and Darren Beriro**

This document summarises a collective understanding of the National Land
Data Programme (NLDP) Devon pilot area. It introduces the pilot area
partners and provides an outline of their progress, ambitions, risks and
opportunities in the context of the NLDP.

**Who is working on the pilot area project?**

The Devon pilot area is being led by [Food, Farming and Countryside
Commission](https://ffcc.co.uk/) (FFCC), a UK wide charity funded
primarily by the Esm√©e Fairbairn Foundation and founded by the Royal
Society for Arts.

FFCC has a mission to have a positive impact on our climate, nature,
health and economy through actions, informed by conversations with a
variety of public and private stakeholders including land owners,
farmers, local communities, Government and academia. The FFCC
[board](https://ffcc.co.uk/our-people/board) and team of
[commissioner](https://ffcc.co.uk/our-people/commissioners)s is
comprises highly influential individuals who represent a range of
sustainable food and farming interests.

The outcome of their first report, [Our future in the
land](https://ffcc.co.uk/library/our-future-in-the-land), provided the
mandate to create a national [Land Use
Framework](https://ffcc.co.uk/what-we-do/land-use-framework) for
England. This framework aims to deliver integrated, collaborative and
place-based decision making and to optimise multifunctional benefits
from our land. Another key outcome was identifying the need for local
and community-based flood resilience measures and the need to integrate
these in other land planning decisions.

The Land Use Framework is part of the NLDP but also part of the a large
regional initiative called the [Flood and Coastal Resilience Innovation
Programme](https://www.devon.gov.uk/floodriskmanagement/flood-and-coastal-resilience-innovation-programme-fcrip/)
(FCRIP). The FCRIP is funded through the Environment Agency and led by
Devon County Council. It aims to enable local stakeholders to identify
and implement lost cost flood adaptation and resilience measures.

Key contacts and roles for FFCC include:
-   Alison Caffyn, Senior Researcher: Land Use
-   Tom Burston, Director of Policy and Research
-   Nick Paling, Project Manager, Westcountry Rivers Trust
-   Sarah Wigley, Westcountry Rivers Trust
-   Data specialist to be recruited at Environment Agency, working with
    Tom Dauben, Flood & Coastal Risk Management Senior Advisor

**Who are the local partners?**

FFCC work with a number of partners in the Devon pilot area data owners
and users, decision-makers and impacted parties e.g. Westcountry Rivers
Trust, Environment Agency, Devon Communities Together, Local
Authorities, National Parks and AONBs, National Trust, National Farmers
Union etc. Each organisation is invested in improving land use decision
taking to address the current crises in climate and nature and help
transition towards more sustainable farming systems. They are interested
in how the developing a Devon Land Use Framework will deliver more
resilient and adaptive land use decision-making.

**What problems are planned to be addressed during the NLDP?**

-   Currently, land use decision making across England is fragmented.
    There is a historic divide between landowners making decisions
    about their future land use and management and the planning system
    which addresses housing, industry and infrastructure type
    development.

-   Land use guidance and data is also fragmented and often conflicting
    across governmental departments e.g. between planning for nature
    and the environment, for agriculture, for housing and for
    economic, infrastructure, energy, defence developments.

-   Land use decisions often do not take into account the same factors,
    use the same data sources or consider neighbouring land uses.

-   A framework for would help decision makers use the same principles
    and take a more strategic approach to work towards government
    targets.

-   Some critical factors are not currently taken into account when
    making a land use decision such as the need to sustainably feed
    ourselves and the links between urban and rural areas.

-   The wider impact of land use decisions is not always considered,
    e.g. draining a field can increase the damage caused by flooding
    in an adjacent area.

**What does success look like for FFCC?**

Within the duration of the NLDP, FFCC plans to co-produce a land use
framework in partnership with many local stakeholders. This will include
improving the awareness, availability and usage of key land data to
enrich decision taking. Success would be producing a Devon Land Use
Framework, which has been found to be helpful to multiple land use
decision makers and which local authorities and other organisations and
landowners are interested in adopting into their ongoing planning
processes. There may within the same timeframe be serious interest from
national government for a cross departmental approach on implementing
such a framework for national land use decision making and processes.

The NLDP will enable this by creating a working prototype Land Data
Platform which the framework can reference directly as the go to
location for land use data around a set of specific use cases.

Gathering insight into the data used to make planning decisions
including housing, food, farming, flooding and surrounding land use will
be a key part of the framework. It will also include guidance on key
engagements within the community which should be undertaken when making
decisions.

**Risks and opportunities**

-   A framework that could be adopted in policy

-   Timescales for becoming fully resourced

-   Securing engagement within a suitable timeframe

-   Well-connected and experienced in engaging with LGCs
