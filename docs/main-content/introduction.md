### National land data Programme

# Programme Overview

### Darren Beriro and Tom Fletcher, November 2021

The Geospatial Commission's [National Land Data Programme
(NLDP)](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/geospatial-commission-launches-pilots-to-improve-how-data-about-land-is-used-in-the-uk)
2021-2023 is a Â£4.56m programme funded by the Government's [Shared
Outcomes
Fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spending-review-2020-documents/spending-review-2020#shared-outcomes-fund).
The NLDP aims to assess the feasibility and value of a common approach to land data for decision making, including joining
up land data and identifying opportunities to improve its availability, accessibility and utilisation.
Central departments across Whitehall are closely involved. Defra, BEIS, DLUHC, DfT and ONS all
sit on the Programme Steering Board to ensure policy alignment with the Programme delivery.

The NLDP aim will be achieved through collaboration with central Government departments, the Geospatial Commission, the British Geological survey and  three
pilot areas: Northern Ireland, West Midlands and Devon. The NLDP pilots will provide insights
into current land use data challenges to help improve data that supports effective decision-making
and contributes towards critical government priorities, including working towards net zero,
infrastructure and housing development.

The NLDP will be informed by the development of use cases for each pilots area. These will be based on problem statements, personas and use stories - 
focussing on pressing data challenges and government priorities around land use decision making. Each of the pilot
areas present a unique and focused set of pressures, opportunities and challenges that will feed
directly into the development of an alpha land data platform between January 2022 and March
2023.

The platform will be a working alpha prototype developed by an external provider following the
conclusion of a procurement by end of this year. The platform is a working prototype and will
provide a safe space to temporarily host data and new digital tools that are expected to help
solve the data-driven challenges identified by each pilot area. The Programme will seek to test
the viability and value for a national-scale model.

The platform will be set up for use during the project only. There will be no public access and it
should be considered a safe space to experiment with new ideas, such as merging datasets and
different approaches to data visualisation.

Please see Figure 1 for a diagram specifying the six programme workstreams with descriptions
(and timeframes where applicable). The NLDP team will provide further details on programme
timelines by the end of the year.

## User requirements research outputs
*	Pilot Area Overviews
*	Polot Area Use Cases
*	Pilot Area Stakeholder Personas
*   Pilot Area Stakeholder User Stories

### Pilot Area Overviews

>The pilot overviews are designed to give an insight into the individual pilot areas. They describe who the organisations involved, who the main points of contact are, what they are currently working, local challenges on and what success looks like to them. The overviews are a first look into the minds of the organisations that are the point of contact for each pilot area and also should share who their key stakeholders are.

### Use Cases

>NEED TO EXPLAIN WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE USE CASE - PROBLEM STATEMENTS, PERSONAS, USER STORIES AND BENEFITS ASSESSMENT

>The use cases for each pilot area point of contact will describe where the national land data platform fits in with their particular ambitions and those of their stakeholders. They will be presented as a statement of how the NLDP will help them succeed

### Personas

< THIS SHOULD BE BASED ON PAULIUS' SPEC FOR A PERSONA?
>There will be a persona for each stakeholder of the pilot areas that would have a reason to interact directly with the NLDP. The personas will consist of:
>    1. Who the stakeholder is - what is their job role and who do they work for
>    2. How they spend their time currently - what do they spend most of their time doing with relation to lad planning
>    3. Their problem statement - A disemmination of the information above into a statement of a problem the NLDP could solve
>    4. Opportunities - a list of possible solutions to the problem statement

### User Stories

>The user stories will describe processes that the personas above follow in relation to land planning i.e. identifying sites. The user stories will follow:
>    1. What is the current process - what do they currently do when identifying a site
>    2. Where is the greatest effort required - where do they currently spend the most time or what is the hardest part when identifying a site e.g. historic land use data not accessible
>    3. What could the process look like with the creation of the NLDP - with the creation of the NLDP what could change i.e. perhaps the time to find the historic land use data would be greatly reduced as it was in one central accessible location.
