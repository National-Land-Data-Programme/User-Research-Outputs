### National land data Programme

# Programme Overview

### Darren Beriro and Tom Fletcher, November 2021

This document pulls together information on the Geospatial Commission's
National Land Data Programme (NLDP) for pilot areas and partners to use
and share with their stakeholders as appropriate. Further information on
the NLDP is available in Geospatial Commission's documentation[^1].

The Geospatial Commission's [National Land Data Programme
(NLDP)](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/geospatial-commission-launches-pilots-to-improve-how-data-about-land-is-used-in-the-uk)
2021-2023 is a Â£4.56m programme funded by the Government's [Shared
Outcomes
Fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/spending-review-2020-documents/spending-review-2020#shared-outcomes-fund).
The NLDP aims to assess the feasibility and value of a common approach to land data for decision making, including joining
up land data and identifying opportunities to improve its availability, accessibility and utilisation.
Central departments across Whitehall are closely involved. Defra, BEIS, DLUHC, DfT and ONS all
sit on the Programme Steering Board to ensure policy alignment with the Programme delivery.

The NLDP aim will be achieved through collaboration with central departments and the three
pilot areas: Northern Ireland, West Midlands and Devon. The NLDP pilots will provide insights
into current data access challenges to help improve data that supports effective decision-making
and contributes towards critical government priorities, including working towards net zero,
infrastructure and housing development.

The Programme will work with central departments and pilot area partners to develop use cases
which correspond to both pressing data challenges and government priorities. Each of the pilot
areas present a unique and focused set of pressures, opportunities and challenges that will feed
directly into the development of an alpha land data platform between January 2022 and March
2023.

The platform will be a working alpha prototype developed by an external provider following the
conclusion of a procurement by end of this year. The platform is a working prototype and will
provide a safe space to temporarily host data and new digital tools that are expected to help
solve the data-driven challenges identified by each pilot area. The Programme will seek to test
the viability and value for a national-scale model.

The platform will be set up for use during the project only. There will be no public access and it
should be considered a safe space to experiment with new ideas, such as merging datasets and
different approaches to data visualisation.

Please see Figure 1 for a diagram specifying the six programme workstreams with descriptions
(and timeframes where applicable). The NLDP team will provide further details on programme
timelines by the end of the year.
